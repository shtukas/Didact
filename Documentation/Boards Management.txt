A lot of functions have a signature similar to this one

```
Waves::listingItemsPriority(board)
```

with a selector like this

```
.select{|item| BoardsAndItems::belongsToThisBoard(item, board) }
```

and the expectation is that if the argument is nil then we return all items that are not attached to a board, and if the argument is a board then we return elements attached to this board.

By convention we also support the argument "all", which then returns all the items, indiscriminate to
their board attribution or not.
