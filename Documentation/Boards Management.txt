A lot of functions have a signature similar to this one

```
Waves::listingItems(board)
```

with a selector like this

```
.select{|item| BoardsAndItems::belongsToThisBoard1(item, board) }
```

and the expectation is that if the argument is nil then we return all items that are not attached to a board, and if the argument is a board then we return elements attached to this board.

We also support the argument "all", which then returns all the items, indiscriminate to
their board attribution or not.

We also support the argument "managed", which return board items when the board is not yet at capacity.
