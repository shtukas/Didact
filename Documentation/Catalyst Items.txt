Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

    - parent           : nil or Tx8

Tx8 {uuid, position}

Tx8 is a general child parent relationship declaration system. At the moment we conventionaly only allow cases and floats to belong to threads

Each catalyst item can have `d2031` attribute that point to a core
