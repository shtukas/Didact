Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

    - parent           : nil or Tx8
    - priority         : boolean

Tx8 {uuid, position}

Tx8 is a general child parent relationship declaration system. At the moment we conventionaly only allow cases and floats to belong to threads

The `priority` boolean can be carried by any catalyst item, but it is effective only when carried by a direct child of a core. If there is one such item, then all the cores with such items are selected and all such items are selected.
