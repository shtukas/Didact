Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

    - parent           : nil or Tx8

Tx8 {uuid, position}

Note that there can be a Tx8 child / parent relationship between any two elements. 

We have, for instance, wave with thread parents, for the timespans.
We have items with thread parents.

Note that threads have a specific `parents` attribute, for cross polinisation.
