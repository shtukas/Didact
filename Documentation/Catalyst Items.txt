Database:
    create table Items (_uuid_ string primary key, _mikuType_ string, _item_ string)



Collections are markers that help aggregating the items that cannot be run now and need a particular condition to be true, for instance, being home, being online, being in the office etc.

TxCollection
    "uuid"     => String,
    "mikuType" => "TxCollection",

{
    "type"     => "fixed"
    "position" => 0.1
}
