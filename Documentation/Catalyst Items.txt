Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

Policies:

    P1: Tasks can have a parent that is either a NxCore, or a NxStack or a NxPool.

    P2: Tasks can have an engine or a deadline.

    P3: NxStacks need to have either: an engine or a deadline or a parent that is a core.

    P4: NxPools need to have either: an engine or a deadline or a parent that is a core.

    P5: The NxTasks that do not have a parent or an engine or a deadline, will be handled by the two grids.
