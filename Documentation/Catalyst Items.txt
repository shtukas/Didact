Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

Elements can have a `parent` attribute that contain an item uuid, and a `children` attribute that is either null or is a Array[Tx8]

Elements can also have a `deadline` attribute that link to a NxDeadline object.
