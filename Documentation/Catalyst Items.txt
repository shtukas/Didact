Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "tmpskip1"       : "YYYY-MM-DD" skipped for the entire day
    - coreX-2300       : uuid of core # (optional)

A NxTask has a global position, and can have a TxCore and a NxCollection and a TxEngine

A NxCollection can have a TxCore and a TxEngine, and many NxTasks

A TxCore can have many NxCollection and many NxTasks.

Orphans are 
    - NxTasks without a TxCore or a NxCollection
    - NxCollections without a TxCore or a TxEngine
