Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType"). 


Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"   : coredata reference string
    - "boarduuid" : board uuid (1)
    - "locked"    : boolean # true if the item is locked in the listing
    - "skipped"   : boolean # true if the item is skipped in the listing

(1) Not for NxBoards and NxProjects.
