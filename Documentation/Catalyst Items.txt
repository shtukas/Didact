Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

Some elementd can have an engine, mostly tasks and containers (pools and stacks)
