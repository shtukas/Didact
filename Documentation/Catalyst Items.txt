Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType").

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String
    - "tmpskip1"       : TmpSkip1

    - parent           : nil or Tx8
    - priority         : boolean

Tx8 {uuid, position}

Tx8 is a general child parent relationship declaration system. At the moment we conventionaly only allow cases and floats to belong to threads

The `priority` boolean can be carried by any catalyst item, but is effective only for cores, children of cores and top threads. It decides whether the element shows up as listing item or not. More exactly, if the parent has at least one priority child, then all priority children are shown in recovery time order, otherwise the children are shown in the position order (see exception below). 

nb: Cores are always ordered in recovery time (or more exactly completion time) order.

nb: Children of cores, unless some are priority, are shown in that fancy method we are using.
