Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType"). 

Cross types conventions:

    - "field11"   : coredata reference string
    - "boarduuid" : board uuid (1)
    - "parking"   : null or unixtime at which the item will no longer be parked
                    In parking, the item is skipped and is displayed in yellow.

(1) Not for NxBoards.
