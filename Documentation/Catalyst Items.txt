Catalyst items are json object with at least a uuid ("uuid") and a miku type ("mikuType"). 

Cross types conventions:

    - "n3timestamp"    : Unixtime, Float (2)
    - "field11"        : coredata reference string
    - "boarduuid"      : board uuid (1)
    - "parking"        : null or unixtime at which the item will no longer be parked
                         In parking, the item is skipped and is displayed in yellow.
    - "doNotShowUntil" : null or unixtime
    - "note"           : null of String

(1) Not for NxBoards.

(2) Carried by all objects, help with resolution
