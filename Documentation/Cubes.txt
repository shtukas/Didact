create table _datalog_ (_recorduuid_ text primary key, _recordTime_ float, _recordType_ string, _data_ blob)

Rules:

    0. _recordTime_ is epoch time float
    1. _recordType_ takes the two values: "datablob" and "attribute"
    2. In the case of attribute we expect a json encodable value that is going to be json encoded.
    3. In the case of a datablob, the nhash is the recorduuid
