We do not have a shared mercury channel, so we use those specific objects to record and signify that a Dx8Unit needs to be garbage collected.

{
    "uuid"     => String
    "mikuType" => "Dx33"
    "unixtime" => Float
    "datetime" => DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    "unitId"   => String # Unit Id of the Dx8 to be garbage collected
}
