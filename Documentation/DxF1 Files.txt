# DxF1 Files, are the nodes of the network. They are sqlite files. The file name is the sha1 of the objectuuid.

create table _dxf1_ (_objectuuid_ text, _eventuuid_ text primary key, _eventTime_ float, _eventType_ text, _name_ text, _value_ blob);

The two possible types for eventType are "attribute" and "datablob".

In the case of "attribute" the value is JSON encoded. In the case of "datablob" the name is a nhash and the value is a data blob.
