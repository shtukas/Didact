DxPure File Management

1. When we create the file, for instance in DxPure::issueDxPureAionPoint, then we:
    - put the file in the BufferOut
    - copy it to XCache
    - drop it on the comm line

2. When we convert an existing aion-point, in Nx111::access, we:
    - move the file to the BufferOut
    - copy it to XCache
    - drop it on the comm line

3. When we process the commline, in SystemEvents::processCommsLine, we:
    - move the file to the BufferOut (this is in case the target instance get to sync with EnergyGrid, before the instance that made the file)
    - copy it to XCache
    - remove the file from the commline

4. When we process the BufferOut, we:
    - move the file to EnergyGrid
    - copy it to XCache
    - remove the file from BufferOut
