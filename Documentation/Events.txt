### Events

We have two types of events

1. Internal events.

2. Global events, published to the other machine(s)

### Internal only events

{
    "mikuType"   => "(object has been updated)",
    "objectuuid" => objectuuid,
}

{
    "mikuType"   => "(object has been logically deleted)",
    "objectuuid" => objectuuid,
}
