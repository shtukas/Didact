### Events

We have two types of events

1. Internal events, at the time those lines are written and reason why they were introduced, mostly used for decaching.

2. SQS events. They are composed of Librarian objects and machine to machine events that are not Librarian objects: NxBankEvent and NxDoNotShowUntil.
