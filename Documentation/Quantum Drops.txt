Quantum Drops are objects that live on the Nyx Network but that also have synchronised presences in the regular file tree.

The main logic is:
    1. If the element on the Nyx network is updated then the file tree nodes are also updated
    2. If a file tree node is updated, then the Nyx node is updated and then any other file tree node is also updated.

Essentially a Quantum Drop is an array of Quantum States, A quantum state is a timed aion point rootnhash.

NxQuantumState {
    "uuid"      : String
    "mikuType"  : "NxQuantumState"
    "unixtime"  : Float
    "rootnhash" : String
}

Quantum Drops on the Nyx Network looks like this:

NxQuantumDrop {
    "mikuType"      : "QuantumDrop"
    "quantumStates" : Array[NxQuantumState]
}
