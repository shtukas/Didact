Quantum Drops are objects that live on the Nyx Network but that also have synchronised presences in the regular file tree.

The main logic is:
    1. If the element on the Nyx network is updated then the file tree nodes are also updated
    2. If a file tree node is updated, then the Nyx node is updated and then any other file tree node is also updated.

Quantum Drops could be a special case of PureData, but they are instead their own Nyx network type: 'QuantumDrop'.

Essentially a Quantum Drop is an array of Quantum States, A quantum state is a timed aion point rootnhash.
