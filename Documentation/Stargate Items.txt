Any stargate item, also known as Miku typed item, should at least have the following attributes:

"uuid"         : String
"uuid_variant" : String # Primary Key
"variant_time" : Float
"mikuType"     : String
"unixtime"     : Float
"datetime"     : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu

This is what the file system check expects.
