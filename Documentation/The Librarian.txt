### Librarian Objects

To be Librarian acceptable, an object must have at least the two keys: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"

We can retrieve objects individually by "uuid" or collectively by MikuTypes.

Objects of the Nyx Network, so essentially Nx100 must have: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"
    - "unixtime"
    - "datetime"

The unixtime (integer, but also float) should represent the time the object was created, and the datetime (DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu) should represent the logical position of the object on the Nyx timeline.

Some items carry a "universe" attribute (notably the Catalyst items). If there isn't one, the Librarian will set a default one.
