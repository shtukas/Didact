### Librarian Objects

To be Librarian acceptable, an object must have at least the two keys: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"

The Librarian will then add the following attribute:
    - "librarianStorageTime" : integer, milliseconds epoch

We can retrieve objects individually by "uuid" or collectively by MikuTypes.

Moreover, objects expected to be on the Nyx Network must also have a "unixtime" and a "datetime" attribute. The unixtime (integer, but also float) should represent the time the object was created, and the datetime (DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu) should represent the logical position of the object on the Nyx timeline.

librarianStorageTime doesn't need to be set by makers of the object, it is set by the libraria n itsef every time the object is sent to the object store. Note that this causes the object to be re-fsck'ed since the trace is different even though it carries the same information.
