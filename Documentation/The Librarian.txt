### The Librarian manipulate JSON objects which encode the stuctures used both by Catalyst and Nyx.

Those objects are stored in their own Fx1 file aong with the binary data they refer to, including but not limited to, Aion Hierarchies.

### Librarian Objects

To be Librarian compatible, an object must have the following keys: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"

    - "lxHistory"   : Array[Id]

lxHistory is automatically updated by the Librarian when the object is stored.

Everytime time the object is stored, a new random Id is decided and added at the end of the history.

Essentially, ObjectB can replace ObjectA if the history of ObjectA is a (strict) subset of the history of ObjectB.

We can retrieve objects individually by "uuid" or collectively by "mikuType"s.

objects-store.sqlite3
CREATE TABLE _objects_ (_objectuuid_ text primary key, _mikuType_ text, _object_ text);

### Logical Delete

Objects are not immediately erased from the local database. They are first logically deleted. They can be destroyed later.

### Objects of the Nyx's network

Objects of the Nyx Network, so essentially NxDataNode must have: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"
    - "unixtime"
    - "datetime"

The unixtime (integer, but also float) should represent the time the object was created, and the datetime (DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu) should represent the logical position of the object on the Nyx timeline.
