### Librarian Objects

To be Librarian acceptable, an object must have at least the two keys: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"

We can retrieve objects individually by "uuid" or collectively by MikuTypes.

Objects of the Nyx Network, so essentially Nx100 must have: 
    - "uuid" 
    - "mikuType"
    - "unixtime"
    - "datetime"

The unixtime (integer, but also float) should represent the time the object was created, and the datetime (DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu) should represent the logical position of the object on the Nyx timeline.

Some items carry a "universe" attribute (notably the Catalyst items). If there isn't one, the Librarian will set a default one. 

Database:

objects.sqlite3
CREATE TABLE _objects_ (_objectuuid_ text primary key, _mikuType_ text, _object_ text, _ordinal_ float, _universe_ text);

### Librarian Log

objects-global-log.sqlite3
CREATE TABLE _objectslog_ (_recorduuid_ text primary key, _recordtime_ float, _objectuuid_ text, _object_ text);

When an object is deleted, we specify this in the log with a special object

{
    "uuid"     : String # same uuid as the object being deleted.
    "deletion" : true
}
