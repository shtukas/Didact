categories

    - ["Monitor"]                : Floating items for on going monitored/HUD'ed processes

    - ["Dated", Date]

    - ["Priority Communication"] : Typically created as a Nx50 from a Inbox item in the (work) domain

    - ["Asap"]                   : Displays between "Priority Communication" and the rest, use sparcely...
                                 It's more towards the sprit of the Nx50 to not use it

    - ["Quark"]                  : The original list is the list of items as it was on 19th Nov 2021

    - ["Vienna"]                 : Indicates that the item came from Vienna.

    - ["Standard"]               : Standard (essentially not any other category)
