* The main Nyx object, the main node of the Nyx Network is the Nx31


* Nx31 are fundamentally Librarian objects, and the Librarian definition is 

Nx31 {
    "uuid"        : uuid,
    "mikuType"    : "Nx31"
    "datetime"    : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    "unixtime"    : unixtime
    "description" : description
    "atomuuid"    : UUID of an Atom
}

All librarian objects have "uuid" and "mikuType" attributes in common.

* Nx31 objects are linked by bidirectional arrows (at the time these lines are written -- will change soon).

* The Tags are Nyx specific, stored in tags.sqlite3, and present as

Tag {
    "uuid"      : String
    "unixtime"  : String
    "owneruuid" : String # uuid of the Entity that this tag is attached to
    "payload"   : String
}


* Searchables are 
    - The Nx31 description
    - The Nx31 uuids
    - The tags payloads
