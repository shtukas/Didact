### Introduction

On May 29th 2022, the decision was taken to make each node of the Nyx network its own file, called a fx12. They are invariably SQLite files, with a `.fx12` suffix.

Each file has at least a `filetype` table, with the schema 

```
create table _filetype_ (_id_ text);
```

which contains a single record holding the file's version. The filetype id exists because we expect that the SQL schema might evolve in the future, but due to the distributed aspect of the system we will not be able to upgrade all the points in batch (simply because we will only have the local instances of those nodes, while other instances reside on other machine which could be running older version of the program).

As a general rule, if the program encounter a given filetype that it doesn't know how to operate on, then it should simply ignore that file. (It can indeed happen that an older not yet upgraded version of the program receives, through standard communication channels, a very recent version that it cannot handle.)

At the moment the known versions are 
    001-8b0aac1fcea0 : original version based on Marbles, managed from the Fx12 module.


### Fx12, 001-8b0aac1fcea0

Initialisation:

```
"create table _filetype_ (_id_ string)"
"insert into _filetype_ (_id_) values (?)", ["001-8b0aac1fcea0"]
"create table _data_ (_key_ string, _value_ blob)"
```

The table data is used as general key/value store. The json object is stored at key `object`.
