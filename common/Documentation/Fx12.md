### Introduction

Each element of the Nyx universe is its own file called a fx12. "Nyx universe" not only refers to the nodes of network but also any special purpose item. They are invariably SQLite files with a `.fx12` suffix.

File initialisation:

```
db.execute "create table _data_ (_key_ string, _value_ blob)", []
db.execute "insert into _data_ (_key_, _value_) values (?, ?)", ["schema_type", "001-8b0aac1fcea0"]
```


### Fx12, 001-8b0aac1fcea0

At the moment the known version is: `001-8b0aac1fcea0`. Original version based on Marbles, managed from the Fx12 module.

The expected k/v attributes are 

- `uuid`: String (get: `Fx12s::uuid(filepath)`)
- `schema_type`: "001-8b0aac1fcea0" (get: `Fx12s::schema_type(filepath)`)
